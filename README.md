# ccv_bootcamp_phylogenetics

Phylogenetics workshop for CCV Bootcamp 2024

This 1.5hr workshop will cover:

 * What a phylogenetic tree is and how to read onew
 * How to run IQTREE2 and similar phylogenetic inference programs on Oscar
 * How to use ggtree2 and treeio to manipulate and visualize trees

This workshop will **not** cover:

 * Phylogenetics theory and methods, i.e. substitution models, what bootstrapping and maximum likelihood are, coalescent models, etc.
 * Time trees and tree dating
 * Alignment

Phylogenetics is a very deep and computation heavy field and covering the basics of it is the topic of specific molecular evolution workshops that take the entire week. This will be enough to get you started with understanding how to run very computationally intensive programs on OSCAR and then how to visualize trees in a programmatic way.

Material is based off of these resources with some modifications:
